# Color Palette Picker
## Description
This website allows a user to generate a random image. From this random image the user can then select a color and create a color theme that displays four other colors making up a five color theme.

## Technologies Used
 - Bulma - CSS FrameWork
 - Unsplash API - Random image provider
 - TheColorApi - Color Theme generator

## Usage
 The user clicks on the generate photo button to generate a random image. They then can choose a color from the image and store it off to the side. The generate theme button will then take that color and generate a full color theme for the user.
